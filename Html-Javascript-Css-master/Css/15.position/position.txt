The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).

Static:
HTML elements are positioned static by default.

An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according
 to the normal flow of the page:

Relative:
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will 
cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to 
fit into any gap left by the element.

Fixed:
element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays 
in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used 
to position the element.

A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

Absolute:
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
(instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, 
and moves along with page scrolling.


Sticky:
An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" 
in place (like position:fixed).
