When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

The z-index helps to specify the stack order of positioned elements that may overlap one another.
The z-index default value is zero and can take on either a positive or negative number.
Z-Index can take the following values:

Auto: Sets the stack order equal to its parents.
Number: Orders the stack order.
Initial: Sets this property to its default value (0).
Inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.
